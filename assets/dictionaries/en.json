These Terms Of Use apply to your use of such services and Applications (together, the “<b>Connected Appliance Services</b>”).</p><p> </p><p>In order to enjoy the Connected Appliance Services your Connected Appliance must be connected to a wireless Internet connection. You are responsible for the installation and maintenance of the wireless Internet connection at the place where your Connected Appliances are located. You also need to install the Application on your mobile device(s) and register an account with Whirlpool.</p><p> </p><p>You need to accept this Terms Of Use and the Privacy Statement in order to use the Connected Appliance Services. By using any Connected Appliance Services, and/or clicking the “I agree” button, you agree to be bound by these Terms Of Use. If you do not agree to the Terms Of Use or any part of them, and do not accept these Terms Of Use and/or the Privacy Statement, you will be unable to access the Connected Appliance Services associated with your Connected Appliance.</p><p> </p><p>From time to time, we may update these Terms Of Use.

Data Usage</i></p><p>Connected Appliances use your wireless Internet connection to provide you with the Connected Appliance Services.

All these uses imply the transfer of a certain amount of data through your relevant connections so you must have an appropriate data plan from your wireless Internet connection at the location of your Connected Appliance and from your mobile service carrier. Please consult your Internet service provider’s or mobile service carrier’s pricing plan to determine applicable data charges, data limitations, restrictions such as permissible uses, and other terms and conditions of service. Whirlpool is not responsible for any charges that your Internet service provider or mobile service carrier may impose. If you wish to avoid such data charges from your mobile service carrier relating to the Connected Appliance Services, stop using and uninstall the Application on your mobile device or disable all notifications through your account settings using the Application.
